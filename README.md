# Answering Business Questions Using SQL

Setup with Google Drive, Colab and Github

Use SQL to answer business questions about a fictional digital music store. The [Chinook database] contains data about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on employees, customers, and the customers' purchases.

The goal in this project is to find answers on the following:

* Which music genres sell the most tracks in the USA?
* What is the sales performance of the shop's employees?
* Which countries have the potential for growth?
* What percentage of purchases are whole albums versus individual tracks?
* Which artist is used in most playlists?
* How many tracks have been purchased versus not purchased?
